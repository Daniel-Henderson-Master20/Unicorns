    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The nicorn is a mythological animal resembling a horse or a goat with a single horn on its forehead. The unicorn appeared in early Mesopotamian artworks, and it also was referred to in the ancient myths of India and China. The earliest description
        in Greek literature of a single-horned (Greek monokerōs, Latin unicornis) animal was by the historian Ctesias (c. 400 BCE), who related that the Indian wild ass was the size of a horse, with a white body, purple head, and blue eyes, and on its
        forehead was a cubit-longhorn coloured red at the pointed tip, black in the middle, and white at the base. Those who drank from its horn were thought to be protected from stomach trouble, epilepsy, and poison. It was very fleet of foot and difficult
        to capture.

    <h2>Did Unicorns really exist??</h2>
    <p>
        An article on BeliefNet.com explains you can find the word ‘unicorn’ in the King James version of the Bible nine times. Later translations refer instead to a wild ox. No one really knows what the original Hebrew word, re’em, referred to. Some scholars
        think a wild ox or an auroch is more likely, while Matt Simon suggests the oryx, which would make sense since people sold their antlers as unicorn horns (2015). An article on BeliefNet.com explains you can find the word ‘unicorn’ in the King James

    <h2>Do you think Unicorns Exist?</h2>
    <p>
        Perhaps instead of waiting for evolution to make a unicorn, people could engineer them. Scientists might use the tools of bioengineering to cobble together the traits of a unicorn from other creatures. Paul Knoepfler is a biologist and stem-cell researcher
        at the University of California, Davis. He and his daughter Julie wrote a book, How to Build a Dragon or Die Trying. In it, they ponder how modern techniques could be used to build mythical creatures, including unicorns. To transform a horse into
        a unicorn, you could try adding a horn from a related animal, Paul Knoepfler says. One approach would be to use CRISPR. This gene-editing tool lets scientists tweak an organism’s DNA. Researchers have found certain genes that are turned off or
        on when animals are growing their horns. So in a horse, “you might be able to … add a few different genes that would result in a horn sprouting on their head,” he says.
